### 👋 Greetings, I'm Seizoxu.

I'm a software engineer with a CS degree and I love building tools that serve online communities -- whether it's analytics, leaderboards, or gameified challenges that people find useful or just fun to interact with.

🛠️ **Languages and tools I'm comfortable with:**
- Java, TypeScript, Python, Bash
- MongoDB, MySQL, Docker, Linux, REST APIs
- Tools: Git, Jenkins, Kubernetes (basic), OAuth2

📌 **Featured Projects**:
- **Zyenyo** – Typing analytics Discord bot that tracks performance, stats, and leaderboards using Java, MongoDB, Actix, and TypeScript, all containerized with Docker. It's been in (mostly) active development since 2022.

- **SMCB / MOWC** – A weekly osu! mouse-only challenge platform with a Flask frontend, Java JDA backend, SQL database, OAuth2 login, and Dockerized services. All built solo from scratch. SMCB is the platform, and MOWC is the weekly challenge it hosts.

You can also find these projects pinned to the top of my GitHub profile.

💡 Currently exploring LLM applications and LangChain. Hoping to integrate AI into future tools and automations I build.
